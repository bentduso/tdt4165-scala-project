# TDT4165 - Scala Project

Please refer to `tdt4165-scala-project.pdf` for answers to the tasks and questions.

## Project Setup Note

I initially completed the first part of the project in a separate environment using Scala 3.5.1 instead of the 
provided skeleton project. This led to challenges when setting up and compiling the tests directly in my project's 
test folder. As a result, I am using a newer version of `scalatest` and have opted for `AnyFunSuite` instead of 
`FunSuite`. Additionally, I omitted the use of postfix notation in the tests. However, the underlying test logic 
remains unchanged.
